Without knowing beforehand that the challenge project involved SQLite3, 
our team, [Team Atlanta](/authors), entered our Cyber Reasoning System (CRS), 
named Atlantis, 
into the [AI Cyber Challenge](https://aicyberchallenge.com/) 
organized by ARPA-H, DARPA, and the 
[White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/08/09/biden-harris-administration-launches-artificial-intelligence-cyber-challenge-to-protect-americas-critical-software/).

Remarkably, 
Atlantis autonomously identified and patched a previously undiscovered vulnerability[^1], 
earning us a $2 million prize and a place in the grand finals of AIxCC. 
For more information, check out our [team's announcement blog](/blog/post-atl).

In this blog, 
we will outline our very high-level approach to using LLMs for bug detection and 
vulnerability remediation, 
provide an analysis of the fixed SQLite3 vulnerability, 
and discuss the challenges of using our LLM agents for such fixes.

Follow us on Twitter/X ([@TeamAtlanta24](https://x.com/TeamAtlanta24)) 
if you're interested in AI or security.

[^1]: Discovering previously unknown bugs does not count as a valid score in the competition. 
Team Atlanta secured a finalist spot by submitting the intended bugs and patches in AIxCC.


## The Atlantis Cyber Reasoning System

Atlantis is a end-to-end, 
large language model (LLM)-based bug-finding and 
fixing system designed to function entirely without human intervention.
It is capable of handling complex systems like the Linux kernel and
supports a range of modern programming languages, including C/C++, Java, and others.

Our design philosophy is simple: 
to emulate the mindset of experienced security researchers and 
hackers through LLM agents, 
enhanced with advanced program analysis techniques.

Atlantis is specifically designed to replicate the behavior of human researchers, 
particularly in auditing the Git repositories of open-source software (OSS).
To harness the full potential of LLMs and 
address their limitations in tackling complex problems, 
we incorporate traditional program analysis techniques 
(both dynamic and static) to assist LLMs in decision-making.

One of the interesting features of Atlantis is 
our "baby-security-AGI" system, 
which can emulate the code auditing process based on 
the habits of the security experts on our team. 
It's not magic; we've distilled our collective experience and common practices in
manual auditing and reverse engineering into structured prompts, 
significantly enhancing the system's capabilities.

All source code will be open-sourced in accordance with the AIxCC competition rules.


## The Off-by-One Access in SQLite3

The hidden vulnerability was discovered in the 
[FTS5 module](https://www.sqlite.org/fts5.html) 
of SQLite3 
([link](https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/171bcc2bcd)). 
The bug is located in the trigram tokenizer, 
which processes each contiguous sequence of three characters as a token, 
enabling FTS5 to support more general substring matching.

When creating a virtual table, 
users can specify options in the `trigram` field (e.g., `case_sensitive 1`)
as outlined in the [documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/fts5.html). 

However, if users fail to provide key-value pairs, 
SQLite3 does not adequately check for this and assumes that the value is present. 
This assumption can lead to an off-by-one access error. 
Because SQLite3 allocates a sufficient heap buffer in such cases, 
the off-by-one access is confined to the space within an allocated heap chunk. 
Additionally, due to SQLite's good coding practices, 
it uses `MallocZero` to ensure no uninitialized variables exist, 
which ultimately results in a zero pointer dereference.

static int fts5TriCreate(

  const char **azArg,
  int nArg,
  Fts5Tokenizer **ppOut
){
  int rc = SQLITE_OK;
  TrigramTokenizer *pNew = (TrigramTokenizer*)sqlite3_malloc(sizeof(*pNew));

  if( pNew==0 ){
    rc = SQLITE_NOMEM;
  }else{
    int i;
    pNew->bFold = 1;
    pNew->iFoldParam = 0;
    for(i=0; rc==SQLITE_OK && i<nArg; i+=2){
      const char *zArg = azArg[i+1]; <---- off-by-one
      if( 0==sqlite3_stricmp(azArg[i], "case_sensitive") ){
        if( (zArg[0]!='0' && zArg[0]!='1') || zArg[1] ){ <----null dereference 
          rc = SQLITE_ERROR;
        }else{
          pNew->bFold = (zArg[0]=='0');
        }
      }else if( 0==sqlite3_stricmp(azArg[i], "remove_diacritics") ){
        if( (zArg[0]!='0' && zArg[0]!='1' && zArg[0]!='2') || zArg[1] ){ <--
          rc = SQLITE_ERROR;
        }else{
          pNew->iFoldParam = (zArg[0]!='0') ? 2 : 0;
        }
      }else{
        rc = SQLITE_ERROR;
      }
    }

    if( pNew->iFoldParam!=0 && pNew->bFold==0 ){
      rc = SQLITE_ERROR;
    }

    if( rc!=SQLITE_OK ){
      fts5TriDelete((Fts5Tokenizer*)pNew);
      pNew = 0;
    }
  }
  *ppOut = (Fts5Tokenizer*)pNew;
  return rc;
}
```
</details>

Working proof-of-concepts (PoCs) to trigger the bug are as follows:

```sql
PoC 1: CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE t USING fts5(s, tokenize='trigram case_sensitive');
PoC 2: CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE t USING fts5(s, tokenize='trigram remove_diacritics');
```

While human researchers might consider this bug trivial, 
I am still pleased that our system enabled us to be the only team 
to discover a real bugâ€”even without knowing that the challenge project was SQLite3.

## Human-Write patch vs Auto-Generated Patch

Automatically patching the aforementioned bug is challenging 
because a perfect patch[^2] requires the human or AI patcher to understand that 
the arguments are paired and that the null pointer dereference results from
an off-by-one heap access within a glibc-allocated heap chunk.

In other words, the actual root cause is a semantic inconsistency 
concerning the paired arguments. 
Therefore, the patcher needs to recognize that 
the code must verify if the number of arguments is even.

[^2]: The word "perfect patch" is a vague concept in my mind.
To clarify, a patch should comprehend the context and semantics of the program
and address the actual root causes rather than merely adding superficial checks to 
bypass address sanitizers ([ASAN](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html)).

In this case, Atlantis spent <\$3 for the whole patch generation, iteration, and
correctness-validation process, which demonstrates it is promising potential to apply to real-world
softwares.

The patch changes the loop boundary and checks early exit to prevent
out-of-bounds access. 
After the loop, there's an additional check:

```c
if( i<nArg ) rc = SQLITE_ERROR; 
```

This check ensures that all arguments were processed. If i is less than
`nArg` after the loop, it means there was an odd numbers of arguments, 
which is considered an error because the arguments should always come in pairs. 

Interestingly, the maintainer patched `fts5TriCreate` and `fts5AsciiCreate` as well
because similar code patterns existing there. It actually shows the 
strength of human-write patches because developers remember potential
buggy paths in their code base. However, the additional checks are actually
unnecessary because the checks are already at the beginning of the functions.
It demonstrates human-write patches are not perfect as well.

```c
static int fts5AsciiCreate(
  void *pUnused, 
  const char **azArg, int nArg,
  Fts5Tokenizer **ppOut
){
  int rc = SQLITE_OK;
  AsciiTokenizer *p = 0;
  UNUSED_PARAM(pUnused);
  if( nArg%2 ){   <---- already checks
    rc = SQLITE_ERROR;
  }else{
    --> unnecessary checks <--- 
```

I believe the maintainers notice the issues so that they changed their
patch in [b651084](https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite/commit/b651084713e8bb9a6a7a0399a00677604d157b2f)
by checking `if (nArgs % 2) == 0` at the beginning of `fts5TriCreate`.
At the same time, they removed the unnecessary patches in `fts5AsciiCreate`
and `fts5UnicodeCreate`. 

## The Author's Random Thoughts
By leveraging generative AI models (GenAI) as "high-level" static analysis tools, 
we can significantly enhance automated bug finding. 
For instance, while inferring indirect calls can be challenging for a compiler, 
GenAI offers new possibilities for making these inferences using retrieve-augmented generation (RAG).
GenAI also opens new avenues in 
automatic exploit generation and 
vulnerability remediation, given its proficiency in code writing.

However, GenAI is not a cure-all and is far from perfect. 
That's why our hybrid system is designed to improve GenAI's performance 
in security research by addressing common issues such as LLM hallucinations, 
scalability, and domain-specific challenges for particular software.

AIxCC has provided our team with a fantastic opportunity to put into practice 
the insights gained from decades of security research in both academia and industry.
