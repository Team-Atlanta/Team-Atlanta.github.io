When testing Java code, however, most vulnerabilities require the invocation of a certain Java API, such as creating an SQL statement (&lt;code&gt;java.sql.Statement&lt;/code&gt;) for an SQL injection bug.
Thus, we target such security-critical APIs with our modified, directed Jazzer to reach and exploit critical code locations faster.
This blog post gives an overview over our directed fuzzing setup for Java challenge problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calculating a distance metric for directed fuzzing requires static analysis to identify critical code locations (aka sinkpoints) and compute distances.
This static analysis happens mostly offline, independent of the modified Jazzer, to reduce the computational overhead in the fuzzer.
However, we still compute the CFG (and, thus, basic block-level distances) in Jazzer to maintain a precise distance metric and allow the update of seed distances during fuzzing.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Jazzer+LibAFL: Insights into Java Fuzzing</title><link>https://team-atlanta.github.io/blog/post-crs-java-libafl-jazzer/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://team-atlanta.github.io/blog/post-crs-java-libafl-jazzer/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;AIxCC involved finding bugs in software written in two languages: C++ and &lt;em&gt;Java&lt;/em&gt;.
The focus of the competition was on the use of LLMs and AI, however, our teams
approach was to balance ambitious strategies alongside proven traditional
bug-finding techniques like fuzzing.
While our team was deeply familiar with fuzzing C++ from decades of academic
research and industry work, Java was uncharted territory for us.
In part of our Java fuzzing development we created a fork of Jazzer that uses
LibAFL as the fuzzing backend and it is available as

This post details some of the lessons we learned about Java fuzzing and the

&gt;Atlantis CRS framework&lt;/a&gt;, specifically designed for Java CPV detection in the AIxCC competition.
It integrates fuzzing, program analysis, and LLM capabilities, with a particular focus on security-sensitive APIs (also known as sinks).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This vulnerability contains a backdoor that enables OS command injection when specific conditions are met.

The sinkpoint (line 20) refers to the location in the target CP where this sink API is called.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
