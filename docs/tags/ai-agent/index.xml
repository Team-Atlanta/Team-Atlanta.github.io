Inspired by Claude Code&amp;rsquo;s strategy, we developed ClaudeLike, an agent dedicated to patch generation. In this post, we introduce the motivation and key features behind the development of ClaudeLike.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When Claude Code was released, we experimented to see whether it could generate patches effectively, as we had previously done with tools like Aider and SWE-Agent. We found that Claude Code performed reasonably well when provided with contextual information such as crash logs. However, we determined that directly integrating Claude Code into Crete would be difficult.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
