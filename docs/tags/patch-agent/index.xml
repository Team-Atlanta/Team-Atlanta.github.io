In this series of blog posts, we will introduce each of our patch agents in detail and explain the rationale behind their designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="diversity-for-good"&gt;Diversity for Good&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To maximize the effectiveness of ensembling, it is crucial to have diverse agents. If all agents are similar, the ensemble will not perform significantly better than any individual agent. Therefore, we intentionally designed our patch agents to be diverse in their approaches, methodologies, and also models used. We newly developed six patch agents, each with its own unique architecture and motivation, as summarized in the table below.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
