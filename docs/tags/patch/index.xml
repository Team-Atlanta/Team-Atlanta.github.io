In this series of blog posts, we will introduce each of our patch agents in detail and explain the rationale behind their designs.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>To maximize the effectiveness of ensembling, it is crucial to have diverse agents. If all agents are similar, the ensemble will not perform significantly better than any individual agent. Therefore, we intentionally designed our patch agents to be diverse in their approaches, methodologies, and also models used. We newly developed six patch agents, each with its own unique architecture and motivation, as summarized in the table below.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>ClaudeLike: How to Apply a Tool-Based Agent to Patch Generation</title><link>https://team-atlanta.github.io/blog/post-crs-patch-agent-claudelike/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://team-atlanta.github.io/blog/post-crs-patch-agent-claudelike/</guid><description>&lt;p>Claude Code is an LLM agent specialized in general-purpose programming tasks and remains one of the most powerful LLM agents to date. Inspired by Claude Code&amp;rsquo;s strategy, we developed ClaudeLike, an agent dedicated to patch generation. In this post, we introduce the motivation and key features behind the development of ClaudeLike.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When Claude Code was released, we experimented to see whether it could generate patches effectively, as we had previously done with tools like Aider and SWE-Agent. We found that Claude Code performed reasonably well when provided with contextual information such as crash logs. However, we determined that directly integrating Claude Code into Crete would be difficult.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vincent, One Puzzle for Our Ensemble Toward High-quality Patches</title><link>https://team-atlanta.github.io/blog/post-crs-patch-agent-vincent/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://team-atlanta.github.io/blog/post-crs-patch-agent-vincent/</guid><description>&lt;p>As mentioned in the previous post, our strategy for patching is to prepare multiple agents to ensure both the robustness and correctness of the system.
To this end, we developed various patch agents, each specialized for different LLM models and tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this post, we would like to introduce Vincent agent, one of the patch agents running under our ensemble-based patching system.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>What surprised us during the competition was that LLMs alone are already quite doing well at generating proper patches.
Given a sanitizer report, LLMs could freely explore the codebase by itself and reason correctly about the given bug—especially when the problematic code appeared near the call stacks in the report.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ensembles of Agents for Robust and Effective Automated Patching</title><link>https://team-atlanta.github.io/blog/post-crs-patch-integration/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Oct 2025 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://team-atlanta.github.io/blog/post-crs-patch-integration/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="why-ensemble-for-patching">Why Ensemble for Patching?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the AIxCC competition, finding vulnerabilities is only half the battle. Once a vulnerability is discovered, it must be patched to prevent exploitation. This is where the Atlantis-Patching system comes into play. As the AIxCC&amp;rsquo;s ultimate mission is to make software secure, it awards more points for patching vulnerabilities than for finding them. In particular, the competition rewards &lt;strong>6 points&lt;/strong> for patching a vulnerability, compared to just 2 points for discovering it. As a result, to win the competition, it is crucial to have a robust and efficient patching system that can quickly generate effective patches for discovered vulnerabilities.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
