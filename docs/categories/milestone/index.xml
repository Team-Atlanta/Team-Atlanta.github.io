our team stood on stage as the winners of the AIxCC Final—a moment we had been working toward
since the competition began.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yet when we heard we placed 1st, relief overshadowed excitement.
Why? While competing head-to-head with world-class teams like &lt;a href="https://theori.io/blog/aixcc-and-roboduck-63447"

was a privilege, the real-time, long-running nature of this competition
demanded extreme engineering reliability alongside novel approaches to succeed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hacking Redefined: How LLM Agents Took on University Hacking Competition</title><link>https://team-atlanta.github.io/blog/post-tkctf-2024/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Dec 2024 12:15:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://team-atlanta.github.io/blog/post-tkctf-2024/</guid><description>&lt;p>For the first time, we deployed our hybrid system,

During the competition, Atlantis concentrated on two pivotal areas:
vulnerability analysis and automatic vulnerability remediation.
Remarkably, the system uncovered 10 vulnerabilities and produced 7 robust patches&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>,
showcasing the practicality and promise of our approach in a real-world hacking competition.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this blog, I’ll delve into some fascinating insights and essential lessons from the CTF experience.
As we prepare to open-source the full details of our system following AIxCC competition rules,
this milestone reflects more than just a technical achievement—it embodies our commitment to advancing LLM-driven security research.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
