&lt;p>In the AIxCC competition, finding vulnerabilities is only half the battle. Once a vulnerability is discovered, it must be patched to prevent exploitation. This is where the Atlantis-Patching system comes into play. As the AIxCC&amp;rsquo;s ultimate mission is to make software secure, it awards more points for patching vulnerabilities than for finding them. In particular, the competition rewards &lt;strong>6 points&lt;/strong> for patching a vulnerability, compared to just 2 points for discovering it. As a result, to win the competition, it is crucial to have a robust and efficient patching system that can quickly generate effective patches for discovered vulnerabilities.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
